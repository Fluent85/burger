# Eat The Burger App

This is my first attempt at building a full app/website, front-end to backend. I am also adding PWA, progessive web application.  This is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser. Functionality includes working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access, enabling creating user experiences similar to native applications on desktop and mobile devices. Since a progressive web app is a type of webpage or website known as a web application, there is no requirement for developers or users to install the web apps via digital distribution systems like Apple App Store or Google Play. 
 
## Motivation

Practice MySQL, Node express handlebars, Node express, CSS, JavaSrcipt, jQuery, and learn more about these backend languages.  Also learn how to build an application from the backend to the front-end to make it a fully functional application.

## How to use? 

The application will prompt the user to add a burger name.  Then from there, the user can eat the burger by pressing the Eat it! button.  Then the user can digest the burger by pressing the Digest it button.


## Issues and future development

Currently the application works.  Heroku currenlty works!  Currently beta testing this application with PWA features.  The app doesn't work while not connected to the internet.  I also have not pushed the PWA changes to heroku.

## Technologies Implemented

HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ajax, Node express, Node express handlebars, MySQL, PWA
