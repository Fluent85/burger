# Eat The Burger App

This is my first attempt at building a full app/website, front-end to backend. 
 
## Motivation

Practice MySQL, Node express handlebars, Node express, CSS, JavaSrcipt, jQuery, and learn more about these backend languages.  Also learn how to build an application from the backend to the front-end to make it a fully functional application.

## How to use? 

The application will prompt the user to add a burger name.  Then from there, the user can eat the burger by pressing the Eat it! button.  Then the user can digest the burger by pressing the Digest it button.


## Issues and future development

Currently the application works.  Still having trouble with the styling of the application.  Also still having issues with the heroku deployment.  I have followed all the steps and I am still getting an error when I want to open the app on heroku.
