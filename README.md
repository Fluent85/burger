# Eat The Burger App

This is my first attempt at building a full app/website, front-end to backend. 
 
## Motivation

Practice MySQL, Node.js Express, Handlebars.js, CSS, JavaSrcipt, jQuery, and learn more about how front-end and backend languages communicate with each other.  Also learn how to build an application from the backend to the front-end to make it a fully functional application.

## How to use? 

* Eat-The-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The application will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
The application will prompt the user to add a burger name.  Then from there, the user can eat the burger by pressing the Eat it! button.  Then the user can digest the burger by pressing the Digest it button.


## Issues and future development

Currently the application works.  Plan on adding more in depth CSS for styling purposes.

## Technologies Implemented
